# Vector-Based Secure Key Storage (VBSKS) 

## Quantum-Resistant Key Storage for Everyone

VBSKS is a revolutionary key storage system that leverages high-dimensional vector spaces to provide quantum-resistant security. This README will guide you through getting started with VBSKS for different use cases.

## Mathematical Security Analysis

VBSKS provides exceptional security by creating an astronomically large search space:

- With 100-dimensional vectors, 10,000 noise vectors, and 5-8 key vectors, the system creates a search space of approximately 10^5017 possibilities.
- This equates to roughly 16,656 bits of security - far beyond current cryptographic standards (128-256 bits).
- Even with quantum computers using Grover's algorithm, the search space would still be approximately 10^2508, making brute force attacks computationally infeasible.
- For comparison, a 256-bit key has a search space of approximately 10^77.

## Installation Options

### Quick Start (Python Package)

```bash
pip install vbsks
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vbsks/vbsks.git
cd vbsks
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## For Consumers

VBSKS provides a simple command-line interface for individual users to securely store their keys.

### Command Line Usage

Initialize a new database:

```bash
python vbsks_cli.py init --db-folder ~/my_keys
```

Store a key:

```bash
python vbsks_cli.py store --key-id my_password --db-folder ~/my_keys
```

Retrieve a key:

```bash
python vbsks_cli.py retrieve --key-id my_password --db-folder ~/my_keys
```

List all keys:

```bash
python vbsks_cli.py list --db-folder ~/my_keys
```

Create a backup:

```bash
python vbsks_cli.py backup --db-folder ~/my_keys
```

### Python Library Usage

```python
from vbsks_easy import VBSKSEasy

# Initialize
vbsks = VBSKSEasy(db_folder="~/my_keys")

# Store a key
result = vbsks.store_key(
    key_id="my_password",
    master_password="very-secure-password",
    data="my secret to encode",
    metadata={"description": "My important password"}
)

# Retrieve a key
result = vbsks.retrieve_key(
    key_id="my_password",
    master_password="very-secure-password"
)
print(result['crypto_key'])  # Base64-encoded key
```

## For Enterprises

Enterprises can use VBSKS through a REST API or integrate directly with the Python library.

### REST API Deployment

Start the API server:

```bash
# Set an API key for authentication
export VBSKS_API_KEY="your-secure-api-key"
export VBSKS_DB_FOLDER="/path/to/secure/storage"

python vbsks_api.py
```

Or use Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/status` | GET | Check API status |
| `/api/keys` | GET | List all keys |
| `/api/keys/<key_id>` | GET | Get key information |
| `/api/keys` | POST | Store a new key |
| `/api/keys/<key_id>/retrieve` | POST | Retrieve a key |
| `/api/keys/<key_id>` | DELETE | Delete a key |
| `/api/backup` | POST | Create a backup |
| `/api/restore` | POST | Restore from backup |

### Example API Call

```bash
# Storing a key
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/keys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "key_id": "api_test_key",
    "master_password": "secure-password",
    "metadata": {"description": "API test key"}
  }'

# Retrieving a key
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/keys/api_test_key/retrieve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "master_password": "secure-password"
  }'
```

### Integration with Enterprise Systems

VBSKS can be integrated with:

- Key Management Systems (KMS)
- Secrets Management platforms
- DevOps pipelines
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems

## For Government & High-Security Organizations

Government agencies and high-security organizations can benefit from VBSKS's advanced security features.

### Enhanced Security Deployment

Configure with maximum security settings:

```bash
python vbsks_cli.py init \
  --db-folder /secure/storage \
  --dimensions 256 \
  --db-size 100000 \
  --key-length 12
```

### Multiple Security Layers

Combine VBSKS with:

1. Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)
2. Multi-factor authentication
3. Secure enclaves or Trusted Execution Environments
4. Air-gapped systems
5. Multiple shares with geographic distribution

### Offline Usage for Classified Environments

VBSKS can operate entirely offline with no external dependencies, making it suitable for air-gapped or classified environments.

### High Availability & Disaster Recovery

Set up a high-availability cluster:

1. Configure multiple VBSKS instances
2. Use shared storage or replicate the database
3. Implement regular backup procedures
4. Set up disaster recovery sites with secure key recovery

## Security Features

VBSKS includes the following security features:

- **Post-Quantum Cryptographic Protection**: Resistant to attacks from quantum computers
- **Vector-Based Key Representation**: Keys are stored as vectors in a high-dimensional space
- **Automatic Key Reconfiguration**: Keys are periodically moved to new positions
- **Shamir's Secret Sharing**: Split keys into multiple parts with a threshold for reconstruction
- **Statistical Noise**: Adds noise to hide statistical patterns
- **Password Protection**: Additional encryption layer using password-derived keys
- **Digital Signatures**: Ensures data integrity and authenticity
- **Constant-Time Operations**: Prevents timing attacks

## Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `VBSKS_DB_FOLDER` | Database storage location | `vbsks_data` |
| `VBSKS_MASTER_PASSWORD` | Master password for map encryption | `vbsks_default_master` |
| `VBSKS_API_KEY` | API authentication key | Random generated |
